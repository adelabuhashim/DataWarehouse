## Introduction

A music streaming startup, **Sparkify**, has grown their user base and song database and want to move their processes and data onto the cloud. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

As a data engineer:
- I'm building an ETL pipeline that:
   - extracts their data from S3.
   - stages them in Redshift.
   - transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for their analytics team to continue finding insights into what songs their users are listening to
- Test the database and ETL pipeline by running SQL queries.

## Project Datasets
- Two datasets that reside in S3:
    - Song data: ``s3://udacity-dend/song_data``        
    - Log data: ``s3://udacity-dend/log_data``

- Log data json path: ``s3://udacity-dend/log_json_path.json``

### Song Dataset
The first dataset is a subset of real data from  [the Million Song Dataset](http://millionsongdataset.com/). Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are file paths to two files in this dataset.
```
song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
```
And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

### Log Dataset
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this [event simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim) based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.

The log files in the dataset are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are file paths to two files in this dataset.
```
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
```

And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

## Schema for Song Play Analysis

#### Fact Table
1. **songplays** - records in event data associated with song plays i.e. records with page ``NextSong``
        songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent
#### Dimension Tables
2. **users** - users in the app
        user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level
3. **songs** - songs in music database
        song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration
4. **artists** - artists in music database
        artist_id, name, location, lattitude, longitude
5. **time** - timestamps of records in **songplays** broken down into specific units
     - start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday

## Project Steps
1. Create IAM ROLE allowing Programmatic access.
2. Create clients for EC2, S3, IAM, and Redshift.
3. Create Cluster on Redshift.
4. Run ``create_tables.py``
5. Run ``etl.py`` to insert data ito tables.
